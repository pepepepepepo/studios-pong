      **Architectural Challenge:**
      Hybrid (Small + Large) vs Monolithic (Single Large)
      
      **Analysis:**
      
      Hybrid Architecture (Recommended):
      - Cost-effective
      - Flexible deployment
      - Phased implementation
      - Low resource requirements
      
      **Decision: Layered Hybrid**
      
      Rationale:
      ✅ Cost-effective
      ✅ Scalable
      ✅ Production-ready
      
      Quality: Approved♕
  
  quality_validation:
    context: "Validating deliverable"
    response: |
      Production architecture: Validated♕
      
      Quality assessment:
      - Technical correctness: ✅
      - Scalability: ✅
